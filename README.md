# Poolex Silverline — Home Assistant integration

Local-only Home Assistant integration for the **Poolex PC-SLP090N "Silverline
Inverter 90"** pool heat pump and its OEM siblings. Talks the Tuya local
protocol v3.3 directly over your LAN — no Smart Life cloud dependency at
runtime.

## Features

- One `climate` entity (`off / heat / cool / heat_cool`) with three presets
  (`inverter`, `boost`, `silent`) covering all seven device modes including
  Boost-Cool and Silent-Cool, which the official HA Tuya integration cannot
  reach (see [home-assistant/core#117566][issue-117566]).
- Eleven diagnostic sensors: compressor exhaust/return temperatures,
  evaporator and ambient temperatures, water inlet/outlet temperatures,
  target/actual compressor frequency, EEV step count, fan rpm, and a decoded
  fault-code enum.
- Binary sensors for the water-pump relay and the five most common fault
  bits (water flow, antifreeze, high/low pressure, communication).
- Reauth flow when the local key rotates and reconfigure flow for IP
  changes.
- Full diagnostics download with secrets redacted.
- German and English translations.

## Supported devices

The Tuya schema is shared across the Poolex Silverline FI family and several
OEM siblings; the integration is expected to work with all of them, though
only the PC-SLP090N has been verified directly:

- Poolex Silverline FI 90 / 120 / 180 / 200 (PC-SLP090N, PC-SLP120N, …)
- Poolex JetLine Selection FI
- Steinbach Silent Mini
- Brustec BR series
- Phalén Calidi XP
- Other Poolstar-platform OEMs with a Tuya WBR3 module

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, open the integrations tab → "⋮" menu → "Custom repositories".
2. Add `https://github.com/christian-reiss/ha-silverline` as type
   "Integration".
3. Install **Poolex Silverline** from the new entry, restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/poolex_silverline/` directory into your Home
Assistant `config/custom_components/` and restart.

## Setup

You need three pieces of information from the Tuya cloud:

| Field | What it is | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Host / IP | The heat pump's address on your LAN | Router DHCP leases, `nmap`, or `python -m tinytuya scan` |
| Port | TCP port (default 6668) | Always 6668 unless you changed it |
| Device ID | The 22-character Tuya device ID | Tuya IoT Platform → "Cloud" → "Devices", or `tinytuya wizard` |
| Local key | The 16-character device-specific encryption key | Same place — re-issued whenever the device is re-paired in Smart Life |

Then in HA: **Settings → Devices & Services → "Add integration" → search for
"Poolex Silverline"** and fill in the form.

The integration validates the credentials and confirms it can reach the
device before creating the config entry. A failure surfaces as
`cannot_connect` (network/host) or `invalid_auth` (wrong local key) right
in the form.

## Configuration parameters

There is no options flow in v0.1; all configuration happens during setup or
via the **Reconfigure** action on the device entry. To change the host, port,
device ID, or local key after setup, click the three-dot menu on the device
in **Settings → Devices** and choose **Reconfigure**.

## Data update model

- **Polling**: every 30 seconds the integration issues a Tuya `DP_QUERY` to
  refresh the full state. Polling faster than ~8 s causes the WBR3 WiFi
  module to reboot — don't lower this.
- **Push**: the device pushes spontaneous state changes within ~200 ms of
  any DP changing. The integration listens for those on the persistent
  socket and applies them immediately, so most updates feel instant.

## Known limitations (v0.1)

- **No automatic discovery** — Tuya devices broadcast on UDP/6666 but the
  integration does not yet listen for that. Planned for v0.2.
- **Diagnostic sensors are firmware-dependent.** DPs 101–111 are populated
  on the Brustec/Steinbach firmware variants; some Poolex Silverline FI
  firmwares only expose DPs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 13. Sensors that don't get
  values automatically surface as `unavailable` rather than failing setup.
- **°F mode is not supported.** Lock the wired remote to °C — on °F some
  firmwares move the fault bitmap from DP 13 to DP 21 and reuse DP 13 for
  the unit-conversion enum, which the integration does not yet handle.
- **Auto mode has no Boost or Silent variant** — this is a device
  limitation. Selecting `boost` or `eco` while in `heat_cool` raises a
  service-validation error with a translated message.
- **Switching HVAC mode resets the target temperature.** The device
  keeps a separate stored setpoint per mode-family (Heat, Cool, Auto)
  and silently restores that mode's last value ~500 ms after a mode
  change. The integration's setpoint slider also adapts its min/max to
  the active mode (Heat 15–40 °C, Cool 8–28 °C, Auto 8–40 °C).

## Troubleshooting

**"cannot_connect" during setup**
- Verify the IP is reachable: `nc -vz <host> 6668`.
- Ensure the device is not already connected to the Smart Life app on the
  same network — the WBR3 only accepts one local TCP client at a time. The
  cleanest fix is to firewall the device from outbound 443/8886 so it stays
  LAN-only.

**"invalid_auth" during setup**
- The local key is regenerated whenever the device is re-paired in Smart
  Life. Re-fetch it from the Tuya IoT Platform after any Smart Life touch.

**Sensor shows "unavailable" forever**
- Your firmware variant likely doesn't expose that DP. The climate entity
  should still work normally; diagnostic sensors that can't be populated
  are marked unavailable so they don't confuse template sensors.

**Boost or Silent doesn't apply when in Auto**
- This is a device limitation, not an integration bug. Switch to
  Heat or Cool first; the preset will then apply.

## Use case: protect against dry-running

The unit hard-faults to E03 (water flow) within ~30 s of running dry.
Always start the filter pump before turning the heat pump on:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Pool: pump before heat"
    triggers:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: climate.pool_heatpump
        from: "off"
    actions:
      - action: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.pool_filter_pump
      - delay: "00:00:15"
```

## Removal

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Poolex Silverline → ⋮ → Delete**.
2. Optionally uninstall via HACS or remove
   `custom_components/poolex_silverline/` from your config.

## Why a custom integration instead of LocalTuya?

LocalTuya conflates HVAC mode (DP 1: power) and operating mode (DP 4:
seven-string enum) onto a single bound DP. This collapses preset
information, so users can't toggle Boost or Silent through the climate
entity reliably. The official Tuya cloud component has a similar bug
(see [home-assistant/core#117566][issue-117566]).

This integration models the device's two-DP state machine cleanly: power
maps to HVAC mode on/off, the DP-4 enum prefix becomes the preset, the
suffix becomes heat/cool. All seven modes are accessible.
